I also do a bit of editing and contribution, when I can, to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org"&gt;Arch Wiki&lt;/a&gt; and I am a moderator for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://plus.google.com/communities/113935870359973712582"&gt;Arch Linux Community&lt;/a&gt; on Google+.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can follow me on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://plus.google.com"&gt;Google+&lt;/a&gt; though I only post occasionally. And feel free to add me on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/HalosGhost"&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt; (I won't accept blind invites; please message me first).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page will serve as a home base for whatever personal projects I am working on (and any professional ones should they ever overlap with the tech-focused paradigm of this site. I will do my best to keep it as up-to-date as possible, but I make no promises with respect to that. Eventually, who knows what it may become?&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>halosghost.github.com//posts/an-introduction.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jul 2013 14:37:09 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
