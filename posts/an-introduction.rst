Having used various GNU/Linux distros for several years, I have a rather hefty set of `dotfiles <https://github.com/HalosGhost/.dotfiles>`_ which you are more than welcome to clone/copy/share/etc. I maintain a few packages for Arch Linux on the `AUR <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?SeB=m&K=HalosGhost>`_ and several others (including some works in-progress) on `GitHub <https://github.com/HalosGhost/Packages>`_. I also do a bit of editing and contribution, when I can, to the `Arch Wiki <https://wiki.archlinux.org>`_ and I am a moderator for the `Arch Linux Community <https://plus.google.com/communities/113935870359973712582>`_ on Google+.

You can follow me on `Google+ <https://plus.google.com/102862389160032018687>`_ though I only post occasionally. And feel free to add me on `Steam <http://steamcommunity.com/id/HalosGhost>`_ (I won't accept blind invites; please message me first).

This page will serve as a home base for whatever personal projects I am working on (and any professional ones should they ever overlap with the tech-focused paradigm of this site). I will do my best to keep it as up-to-date as possible, but I make no promises with respect to that. Eventually, who knows what it may become?
