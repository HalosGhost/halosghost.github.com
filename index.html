        <p>I have been proficient with scripting languages for a long while now, and once upon a time I knew something about Python (but that has long since been forgotten). Having switched to a very minimalist desktop environment (the whole thing with all my customizations is ~1500 sloc of C), and dealing with several C programs (along with having been made an <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/TrilbyWhite/alopex.git">official contributor</a> to one of the projects written entirely in C), I felt it necessary for me to pick up one of the more universal languages and C seemed the obvious choice. I've messed around with a few small C programs as ways of getting my feet wet (i.e., <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/HalosGhost/vulpes.git">vulpes</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/HalosGhost/immio.git">immio</a>). However, a short while ago, I stumbled upon an awesome tool called <a class="reference external" href="http://darkhorse.nu/weatherman/">weatherman</a>, and it inspired me to begin working on an alternative written in C using the <a class="reference external" href="http://forecast.weather.gov">NOAA</a> as a backend rather than weatherbug.</p>
<p>Thus was born, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/HalosGhost/shaman.git">shaman</a>. Originally, I really only wanted it to be able to fetch only the current conditions of a given location so that I could use it to display a relevant weather icon on my statusbar (using vulpes). But, as is the way with these projects, it evolved to also fetch temperature, and now, at the time of writing this post, <tt class="docutils literal">shaman</tt> is capable of fetching the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Reporter name, location and coordinates</li>
<li>Rudimentary hazardous/severe weather warnings</li>
<li>Current weather conditions</li>
<li>Temperature</li>
<li>Heat Index</li>
<li>Wind reports</li>
<li>Humidity</li>
<li>Dew Point</li>
<li>Visibility</li>
<li>Pressure</li>
</ol>
<p>It is also capable of printing mesurements in Imperial and Metric units. I am also working on implementing 7-day forecasts.</p>
<p>Currently, there are a couple of C conventions that <tt class="docutils literal">shaman</tt> does not adhere to (these are planned enhancements that I just need to learn before I can implement). These include native use of <tt class="docutils literal">libcurl</tt> rather than calling a shell and executing <tt class="docutils literal">curl</tt> itself, and using offsets in loops rather than using pointer arithmatic. I do, however, want to finish implementing my planned 7-day forecast feature so <tt class="docutils literal">shaman</tt> can be functionally complete for its first version before I go and start messing around with the backends that I don't fully understand.</p>
<p>There is also one other possible feature that I am considering but I do not know if I will ever implement. If you have ever used the <tt class="docutils literal">date</tt> command or the backend which it utilizes called <tt class="docutils literal">strftime</tt>, then you are likely familiar with their format-code printing system. That is, you pass a string to <tt class="docutils literal">date</tt> which tells it what you want to see and how they should be printed and <tt class="docutils literal">date</tt> complies. Currently, <tt class="docutils literal">shaman</tt> prints information in a pre-formatted style that cannot be edited without editing source. After having released my code on github and publishing an announcement for the project on the <a class="reference external" href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=168620">Archlinux BBS</a>, it has been requested that I add a similar feature (this is something that <tt class="docutils literal">weatherman</tt> actually does too) so that a user may determine the exact output and format of the data which <tt class="docutils literal">shaman</tt> fetches. This would require a great increase of code but would make its use extremely versatile.</p>
<p>Should 7-day forecasts go well, and the migration to <tt class="docutils literal">libcurl</tt> and pointer arithmatic go well, then this may very well become the last thing to implement before considering <tt class="docutils literal">shaman</tt> to be essentially feature-complete. In the meantime, I have plenty to keep me busy on this project.</p>

        <p>One of the projects I have come to work with the most during my tenure using Arch Linux is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/TrilbyWhite/alopex.git">Alopex</a>. It is an extremely lightweight Window Manager (~1500 sloc, with no edits). It is, in many ways, similar to <a class="reference external" href="http://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a>. Like dwm, Alopex is written entirely in C and, as a result, essentially all its configuration options (of which there are plenty) are sourced at compile time. This leads to the whole window manager being in the neighborhood of 70 KiB (74 with all my customizations). When I first became interested in Alopex, the only documentation available was the generously-commented <tt class="docutils literal">config.h</tt> (the file inside which almost all user customizations reside). Partially to help contribute to this project as best I could, and partially to get comfortable editing and contributing to the (fabulous) <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org">ArchWiki</a>, I created <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Alopex">Alopex's ArchWiki page</a>. This, I would like to think, is a very helpful resource (particularly for Arch users). But, much of it is very focused on Arch Linux alone, and since Alopex is not a project explicitly meant for Arch (though all of its contributors are Arch users at the moment), I wanted to help provide documentation that would benefit anyone that might use Alopex.</p>
<p>Thus, I began looking into writing man pages. For anyone who isn't aware, <tt class="docutils literal">man</tt> is a utility for reading "manual" pages provided by upstream projects. The ArchWiki might be nice, but it can be edited by anyone and there is no guarantee that it will stay up-to-date. Man pages, on the other hand, come directly from upstream (or from dedicated contributors), so they should always be the first source to consult. To accurately document Alopex, I felt I needed to create three pages.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/TrilbyWhite/alopex/blob/master/alopex.1">alopex.1</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/TrilbyWhite/alopex/blob/master/alopex.icons.5">alopex.icons.5</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/TrilbyWhite/alopex/blob/master/alopex.config.5">alopex.config.5</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The first is a simple and relatively short page that gives a very wide and concise overview of what Alopex is. The second is an even shorter page documenting how Alopex creates its icons and giving some guidance on how a user might add their own custom icons. In the future, the icons page might become a themes page and also include documentation on Alopex's color-schemes. And, the final page is a much larger page which documents, in-depth, all the features of the <tt class="docutils literal">config.h</tt>.</p>
<p>Man pages are written in a language called groff, but for the most part, they are just plain-text with various formatting modifiers to reflect convention. The basic modifiers you'll need to know to setup the most basic of man pages are as follows:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="16%">
<col width="84%">
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td>.TH</td>
<td>Creates the Page Header</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>.SH</td>
<td>Creates a Section Header</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>.RS</td>
<td>Indents following text</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>.RE</td>
<td>Dedents following text</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>While there are conventions for formatting various things (bold for commands and environment variables, italic for files, etc.), these are largely up to the man page author (though you should make sure that you're use of formatting is consistent throughout your writing, and following convention is a good idea). There are also various ways to format text, there are simple modifiers like <tt class="docutils literal">.TH</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">.SH</tt> which will only affect text that follows on the same line, and there are also more complex modifiers that allow you to add them in-line to a paragraph. Personally, I tend to prefer the in-line versions so I do not have to deal with the disjointed nature of all the extra line-breaks.</p>
<p>For a fabulous, in-depth walk-through of everything you could ever want to know about man pages, take a look at this <a class="reference external" href="http://www.schweikhardt.net/man_page_howto.html">page</a> by Jens Schweikhardt. And feel free to take a look at the pages I wrote and linked to above and use them as a starting point for your own projects.</p>

        <p>Having used various GNU/Linux distros for several years, I have a rather hefty set of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/HalosGhost/.dotfiles">dotfiles</a> which you are more than welcome to clone/copy/share/etc. I maintain a few packages for Arch Linux on the <a class="reference external" href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?SeB=m&amp;K=HalosGhost">AUR</a> and several others (including some works in-progress) on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/HalosGhost/Packages">GitHub</a>. I also do a bit of editing and contribution, when I can, to the <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org">Arch Wiki</a> and I am a moderator for the <a class="reference external" href="https://plus.google.com/communities/113935870359973712582">Arch Linux Community</a> on Google+.</p>
<p>You can follow me on <a class="reference external" href="https://plus.google.com/102862389160032018687">Google+</a> though I only post occasionally.

<p>This page will serve as a home base for whatever personal projects I am working on (and any professional ones should they ever overlap with the tech-focused paradigm of this site). I will do my best to keep it as up-to-date as possible, but I make no promises with respect to that. Eventually, who knows what it may become?</p>
