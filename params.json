I maintain a few PKGBUILDs on the [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?SeB=m&K=HalosGhost), and I do a bit of editing and contribution for the [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org) when I am able to.\r\n\r\nYou can follow me on [Google+](https://plus.google.com/102862389160032018687), though I only post occasionally. And feel free to add me on [steam](http://steamcommunity.com/id/HalosGhost) (blind invites not accepted, please message me first).\r\n\r\nThis page will serve as a basic homepage which I will keep as up-to-date as I can with whatever projects I am working on. Eventually, who knows?","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
